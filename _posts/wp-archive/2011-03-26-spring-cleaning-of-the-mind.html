It's about the time to start thinking about spring cleaning (though in Buffalo it hardly feels like it).

What is the <em>point</em> of spring cleaning?

At its surface, you might be tempted to think it's just about making the house look nice and getting rid of physical things that you don't need or want.

<strong>However</strong>, I'd like to propose that spring cleaning serves a much deeper need: cleaning out your mind.

In my experience, physical objects tend to take up more mental space than physical space.
<blockquote>There's that broken stereo.  Still sitting there.  I should really do something about that...</blockquote>
So assuming that cleaning your mind is the real goal, how else can we get rid of that mental gunk?
<ul>
	<li><strong>Let go</strong> of nonessential commitments</li>
	<li>Identify stressors and <strong>act</strong> to decrease or remove them</li>
	<li><strong>Simplify</strong> all aspects of your life (finances, relationships, routines, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>Meditate</strong>, disconnect</li>
</ul>
As you can probably tell, this post is intended to help the writer as much as the reader.  Here's to a simpler, cleaner, happier rest of the year.
