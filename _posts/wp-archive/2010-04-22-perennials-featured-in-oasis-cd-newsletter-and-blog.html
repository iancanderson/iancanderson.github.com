<a href="http://www.micahsolomon.com" target="_blank">Micah Solomon</a>, the CEO of <a href="http://www.oasiscd.com" target="_blank">Oasis CD Manufacturing</a> (the company that pressed and printed my CD) came across my Kickstarter project to fund my recent album, "Perennials."  He emailed me to thank me for spreading the word about their environmentally-friendly Potato Tray packaging.  He was also interested in how I fan-funded my album through Kickstarter, and ended up writing an email newsletter/blog post about alternative funding sources, using Perennials as an example.

Micah went so far as to take professional shots of my disc and packaging in order to put on my <a href="http://music.iancanderson.com" target="_blank">music site</a>.  It's no wonder he's an expert in customer service!  As long as Oasis CD's prices are somewhat in the range of other companies, I don't see why I won't have all of my CD releases manufactured through Oasis CD.  Excellent service, excellent products, and fair prices.  Doesn't get much better than that!

Anywho, go check out Micah's article (featuring yours truly!): <a href="http://oasiscdblog.wordpress.com/2010/04/22/funding-your-next-cd-project/" target="_blank">Funding your next CD project at Oasis</a>
