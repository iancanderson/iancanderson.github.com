I've decided to pledge to the Haiti cause, specifically to the <a href="http://doctorswithoutborders.org/" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a> cause.

As many of you know, I'm currently accepting pledges, via kickstarter.com, to help with the costs of producing my first album.

The amount that I'll pledge to Doctors Without Borders will be 75% of the kickstarter pledges that I get over the course of the next week, (starting right now and ending next Thursday at 11:59PM).Â  For example, if I receive $100 worth of pledges between right NOW and January 21st, 11:59PM, I will pledge $75 to the cause on Friday, January 22nd.
