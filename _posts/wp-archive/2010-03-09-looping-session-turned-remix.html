Sooo I was in the process of figuring out how to live-loop the bits and pieces of Lunar Sunrise within Ableton Live tonight.  I was too lazy to plug my bass and guitar in, so I pulled up some virtual instruments in Ableton and jammed out with them.  Next thing I knew, I had turned the organic, expansive sounding Lunar Sunrise track into an electronic re-imagination.
What does this mean for Ian C. Anderson music?  Am I going to follow-up Perennials with an electronic remix album?  Am I going to play my original songs live with an electronic twist?  Or will I dismiss this idea tomorrow when I'm not tired and my ears are fresh?  Only time will tell...
