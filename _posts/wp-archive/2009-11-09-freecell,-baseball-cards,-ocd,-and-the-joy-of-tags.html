FreeCell has always been a favorite game of mine.  Recently, while I'm playing it, I've been trying to figure out which aspect of its gameplay that I can't get enough of.   I think I've figured it out.

The point of FreeCell, as with many other solitaire games, is to organize a random mess of cards into 4 orderly piles, based on suit.

I've always been a fan of organizing objects into categories.   As a kid, I would spend hour after hour of my free time organizing and reorganizing my quite large baseball card collection.   Each year I tended to decide on a new category to sort my cards by (team, player name, brand, year, etc.).  I found joy in something that many others would find tedious.

I did, however, stress about determining the best way to organize my baseball cards.  What would've been really amazing back then would be a way to apply tags to each card, then be able to dynamically sort the cards based on whatever category I wanted.  In effect, I wanted to decouple the storage medium from the category.

Okay, so this is hard to do with physical objects.  But in the software world, this is more than possible:  it's becoming the standard way to view data.  GMail's labels are one of the best examples of this in the mainstream world.

So, the point of this post: I like relational databases and tagging systems.
