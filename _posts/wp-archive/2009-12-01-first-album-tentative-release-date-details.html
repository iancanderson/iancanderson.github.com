I'm very happy to announce that I will be self-releasing my very first album in 2010.  It will be an EP, 5 or 6 songs, and I'm planning on a release date in March 2010.

I'm still figuring out the distribution method, but my current plan is:
<ul>
	<li>~300 physical CDs will be replicated, packaged in cardboard sleeves or a Digipak.  (Replication is what the big boys use - instead of simply burning CD-R's, a glass master is created and used to "stamp" the blank discs!)</li>
	<li>CDs will be available for purchase from me personally, via my website (http://music.iancanderson.com), as well as via CD Baby.</li>
	<li>Digital downloads will be available for purchase at my website (http://music.iancanderson.com), as well as several online outlets including iTunes, Amazon, Rhapsody, Napster, eMusic, Amie Street, Spotify, and even Mobile carriers, including Verizon.</li>
</ul>
I won't make as much money per download selling on iTunes as opposed to selling on my site, but I've come to realize that people like the "convenience" of the iTunes store..  Okay I won't get into an anti-Apple rant here.

In short, I'm really excited about this.  However, I have a very busy (though fun) few months ahead as I re-record and mix my songs, and I'll be calling on YOU to help me get my music out into the world.  Thanks ahead of time =)
