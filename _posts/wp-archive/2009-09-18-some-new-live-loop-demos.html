I'm in the process of tweaking a laptop-based live looping setup, using Reaper, my new Novation SL Mkii MIDI controller, and my Behringer FCB1010 MIDI foot controller.

I have a couple of mp3 demos to share with you that demonstrate what a (pseudo)live set might sound like.  Note that I kind of cheated with these mp3s, in the sense that I'm not actually recording the parts live as you hear them.  I used my live looping setup to record them, but what you're hearing is me live-arranging the parts that I previously recorded.  Once I make recording parts more efficient (and actually practice a few sets), I'll be sure to mix down completely live-recorded demos, possibly with some YouTubage.

The jams:
