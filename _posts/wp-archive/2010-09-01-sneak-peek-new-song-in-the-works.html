I'm excited to say that I've been working on a song idea these past two days with some success.  Right now there's just an A section, so it could definitely use another section or two for variety.  So far it's reminding me of Ben Folds Five if they were produced by Burt Bacharach.

I'm not sure what the lyrics will be yet, but for some reason "I can't fight it off" came to me with a melody, so that's in there for now.

Instruments include a sampled grand piano, distorted fuzz bass a la Robert Sledge (using the Big Muff Pi emulation in Line 6's Pod Farm plugin), British Vintage drum kit from Ableton, fun old school synth brass patch from Ableton's "Analog" instrument.

What do you think?  I'm curious to see where this neo-70's kind of vibe will take me..
