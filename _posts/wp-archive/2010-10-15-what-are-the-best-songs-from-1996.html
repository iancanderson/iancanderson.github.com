The eternal question.  I'm sure you've debated this question amongst your friends and family.  Right???

Best from the <a href="http://longboredsurfer.com/charts/1996.php">Billboard Top 100 of 1996</a>, more specifically.

<strong>Something to keep in mind</strong>:  My older sister bought a lot of CDs this year...
<h2>My list (in somewhat of a particular order):</h2>
More obscure artists / 1 hit wonders:
<ul>
	<li>Donna Lewis - Always Forever</li>
	<li>Jann Arden - Insensitive</li>
	<li>Sophie B Hawkins - As I Lay Me Down</li>
	<li>Merril Bainbridge - Mouth</li>
	<li>Everything But the Girl - Missing</li>
	<li>Dishwalla - Counting Blue Cars</li>
	<li>Bodeans - Closer to Free</li>
	<li>Ginuwine - Pony (mostly because it's so ridiculous)</li>
</ul>
More widely-known:
<ul>
	<li>Natalie Merchant - Wonder</li>
	<li>Mariah Carey ft. Boyz II Men - One Sweet Day</li>
	<li>Mariah Carey - Fantasy</li>
	<li>Hootie and the Blowfish - Only Wanna Be With You</li>
	<li>Seal - Don't Cry</li>
	<li>Gin Blossoms - Follow You Down</li>
	<li>Oasis - Wonderwall</li>
	<li>Blues Traveler - Hook</li>
</ul>
I'm considering doing a YouTube series of some of these songs next year, which just happens to be 15 years after these tunes were hits.  Maybe I could continue with that offset (upload covers of 1997 songs in 2012, etc.).  DISCLAIMER: Like most other projects I dream up, this one probably won't come to fruition.
