Today (technically yesterday now..) I started the process of salvaging my (rather poorly) recorded drums from a few years ago into separate MIDI tracks.  Reaper makes this process easier with a JS plugin called drumtrigger - it takes an audio signal as an input (such as a snare drum track), and outputs a MIDI note with a velocity that's proportional to the intensity of the snare hit.  I then route the MIDI notes to my Steven Slate Platinum sampled drum library to get some radio-ready drum sounds right off of the bat.  I also put down a quick take of piano using Kontakt 4's sampled grand piano.  Take a listen to the excerpts before and after the kick, snare, hi hat, and piano were replaced by their virtual counterparts:
