A company that sells cutting edge technological products can't change the address on a pre-order?  Really??
<blockquote>Ian Anderson says, Hi, I preorded a copy of Windows 7 but my address has since changed
Maddie says, Unfortunately we can not modify a pre order, you would need to wait until the order has been reverted into a regular order.
Maddie says, The only way to up date it would be to void the pre order and you can re order online.
Ian Anderson says, Well I got the preorder at a reduced price (less than half of what it is now)
Ian Anderson says, How much of a time window will I have to update it once it becomes an actual order?
Maddie says, You would need to wait until the pre order has been reverted in that case.
Maddie says, Unfortunately I would not be able to advise that. It normally takes 24-48 hours (excluding weekends) to process an order prior to shipping. Once the order has been shipped, the estimated time of arrival will be determined by your selected shipping method.
Ian Anderson says, What? So what should I do?
Maddie says, You would need to wait once the pre order has changed sir. Once you have received the email of the converted order you can contact us.
Ian Anderson says, Okay, thank you
Maddie says, Was I able to resolve your issue or answer all your questions today?
Ian Anderson says, Kind of
Maddie says, Did you further need my assistance?
Ian Anderson says, No thanks
Maddie says, Thank you for contacting Newegg. I hope you have an eggcellent day!
Maddie says, Bye :)</blockquote>
I set up an email reminder with Remember the Milk for the day it releases.  I'm hoping I'll have enough time to "catch" the order before it's final..  Seems silly, does it not??
