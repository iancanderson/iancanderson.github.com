Is there such a thing as a professional brainstormer?  If so, I'm thinking that might be my true calling.

I consider myself an extremely creative person and thinker.  I have a multitude of ideas, good or bad, but I have trouble finishing what I start.  After literally hundreds of these ideas don't come to fruition, then I become immediately discouraged when I come up with another prospect for a great idea, telling myself that it will fail just like the others.

Some of the ideas/projects I've been excited about over the past year or two:

	<li>Music
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://music.iancanderson.com/album/perennials" target="_blank">Perennials EP</a> (actually DELIVERED!?!?!)</li>
	<li>Ben Folds musical (early draft of script/song list)</li>
	<li>Star Wars / Wizard of Oz musical (just brainstormed it w/LM on the way home from Virginia)</li>
	<li><a href="http://youtube.com/iancanderson" target="_blank">Youtube cover songs channel</a> (it's been a while..)</li>
	<li>Endless new "album concepts"
<ul>
	<li>apple/google/microsoft nerd opera</li>

Thinking about it more, Edison didn't work this way at all.  He tried 1,000 different <em>methods </em>to invent the lightbulb.  I'm trying to invent 1,000 different <em>things </em>with one try each.  Hmm...

Is there something wrong with me?  Am I too ambitious?  Spread myself too thin?

Maybe I should just roll with it and rename this website "Adventures of a Scatterbrain."  I'm surprised that I even managed to finish this blog po-
